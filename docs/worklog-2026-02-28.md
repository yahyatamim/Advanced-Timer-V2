# Worklog - 2026-02-28

## Session Summary

Established a minimal "vibe-safe" documentation workflow and aligned V2 docs with the decision to keep `lastEvalUs` as runtime observability metadata.

### Completed

- Added `docs/decisions.md`:
  - Minimal decision-entry template.
  - Workflow rules for contract-first changes.
  - `DEC-0001` documenting `lastEvalUs` as per-card evaluation timing metric.

- Updated `docs/api-contract-v2.md`:
  - Added `docs/decisions.md` in related docs.
  - Clarified `lastEvalUs` semantics:
    - microsecond unit
    - non-negative integer
    - runtime-only (not required in config payloads)

- Updated process docs:
  - `README.md` Section 18.4 now requires decision-log updates for behavior/API/validation changes.
  - `requirements-v2-contract.md` now includes decision-log requirement and lists `docs/decisions.md` as a required artifact.

- Cleaned unresolved merge markers in `docs/acceptance-matrix-v2.md`.

## Next Session Starting Point

1. Add validator tests that assert `lastEvalUs` handling as runtime observability metadata.
2. Ensure portal/runtime UI rendering treats `lastEvalUs` as optional forward-compatible telemetry.
